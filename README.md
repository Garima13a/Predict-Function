# Predict-Function
After performing a parameter update, which is done after some new measurement is collected, the next step is to incorporate motion into our Gaussian calculations. Recall that, as we estimate the location of a robot or self-driving car: * the measurement update *increases* our estimation certainty * the motion update/prediction *decreases* our certainty
